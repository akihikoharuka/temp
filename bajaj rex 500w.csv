But it's noisy as hell. Specially when you increase the pulse.

Talking about cleaning the jars & machine, it's never been easy on any entry level mixers. And it's the same with this one.

The best thing about this mixer is that it takes a little space in the kitchen.

Argha Roy,Overall it is a good mixer grinder,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on June 10, 2020",Verified Purchase,"Very powerful and great mixer grinder.
The only flaw is the lid of the jars, which do not provide a very good seal. At first there were no problems, but after six months the rubber ring washer gets a bit bend, which compromises the sealing and result is scattered half grinded half liquid mixture, which is quite a disaster !
The only soultion is to apply a great amount of pressure on the lid during mixing.

It would have been better if the rubber ring type washer was made in such a way that it would have covered the part where the jar's edge and lid's edge meets, that way it could have provided a greater sealing.",7 people found this helpful

No fruit channel is there to empty the mash that gets accumulated in the juice bump

subham samantray,It is apt for rare use,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on June 26, 2021",Verified Purchase,"So all in all it is completely apt for bachelors, who do rare use of grinder. What I feel it is not ideal for family use, as we need frequent use it. Below are some points that need to be considered before buying it.
1. 1st and most important, very noisy, can't be tolerated for long period of time.
2. Jar lids are not good enough for the speed, you will have put your hand on it while grinding or else it ll just throw it out.
3. It is getting heated very quickly and untouchable rather after 2/3 minutes of action.

So these are the main issues that I could able to find out in 3months of use and hope it stays this much only.

R,Perfect,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on June 19, 2021",Verified Purchase,"It's a good machine.
It was received in good condition without any breakages or flaws as I saw in numerous reviews hence was a little skeptical, but nothing of the sought happened.
However it falls behind on the following pointers:
1. You cannot make the batter for idlis and dosa since it cannot be run for a longer duration, reason being of low wattage of 500 watts. The cutoff switch at the base gets activated and the machine stops . Then I had to switch over to my old Sujata powermatic which is of 900watts and can be run for a longer duration.
2. Sound made on using the machine is much higher, but that's not an issue if it does its work well.
However I loved the mixer grinder as it makes milkshakes, smoothies chutneys and small portions of grinding Dal for dahi vadas and kachories and fresh masalas on a regular basis.",

I am highly satisfied with this product. It gets the work done. I use it mainly to grind spices, mix ingredients for cakes and bread, pulp coriander leaves, etc.

Yes, it is a noisy appliance - but I guess that's because of the powerful 500 Watt motor. When it is in operation one can't hear anything on one's phone or on the television. Yup, it's that loud!

As far as looks are concerned, the design is quite basic... no great shakes. But I would prefer a durable hard-working appliance over a less efficient but pretty looking one any day.

geniezlife,"Average product, can look at other options",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on September 18, 2019",Verified Purchase,"Bought in April 2018, so reviewing it after nearly 1.5 years of use.

What I liked:
- Blades are sharp and very effective. Nothing to complain about even after 1.5 years of regular use
- Compact and occupies less space on the kitchen counter
- Elegant looks and aesthetics at a reasonable price
- Stays planted on the counter with its anti-skid grip on the base

What I hated:
- Of the 3 jars, one jar cracked after less than 6 months of use
- The plastic part at the base of another broke after 1.5 years, so left with only one usable jar (and to my bad luck, it is the smallest jar)
- Noise level is uncomfortable on the ear. Not sure if any other mixer in this price range is much quieter though

Overall:
- If it lasts, it works great. However, longevity is not something I will expect from this product
- Satisfied but not thrilled. If I had to purchase a new product around this price point, I would look at other options",One person found this helpful

The mixer grinder comes in a good package and the material quality is great. It's easy to clean and after using it some months I can confirm it's very durable. Fast grinding speed, and power consumption is moderate (better than other ones in the range).

But its middle one and bigger jars are of no use. because even it can not chop two bananas and apple added with enough milk even after grinding it upto 7 minutes. The noise level of mixer is too high. But grinding capacity is too low. Thought to return and buy some other good brand's mixer but no option left as only replacement is possible.
