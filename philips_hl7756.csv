Kevin,"A good mixer grinder, could be better",4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 1 November 2018,Verified Purchase,"It is a good little mixer grinder. The  design of this thing is amazing, it looks awesome in black and it's sleek curves make it easy to clean the mixer. It has a two pin plug to connect to power. It also has vents to push out the heat while it's grinding. The knob on the front looks great and I like the fact that it has the pulse feature built in the knob itself (NO separate button). It comes with three jars, a 0.3l, a 1l and a 1.5l. I do think the smallest jar could have been made a little bigger (say 500ml). All the three jars have fixed blades, this will be a problem if your blades becomes blunt ( I don't know how you'd replace them). The largest jar has a transparent lid, while the other two have opaque ones. The medium sized jar has no rubber gasket on the inside of the lid, so it doesn't close as tightly as the other two lids do. I don't know why Philips didn't include a gasket. Overall It's nice and the black color makes it blend well with my kitchen slab.",526 people found this helpful
Amazon Customer,4stars but there are few cons,4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 12 December 2018,Verified Purchase,"Philips is a durable brand,blindly trust it.
But have to mention few cons:
1.There is no gasket for the dry jar as per this model,it would have been nice if it came with package.You have buy separately.
2. I purchased the product on 10th Dec with price tag of 3044k but now the price is reduced to 2964k.Why there is price difference within one day.
3.Build quality seems OK but there is motor warranty upto 5yrs to compromise on it.",390 people found this helpful

Blue Al The Feared,Waste of hard earned money,1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 26 November 2020,Verified Purchase,"To everyone who's thinking to go for grinder please save yourself from the trouble. We have used it for many purpose but it's of no use . First of all, this product is only for dry grinding both small and medium with opaque lid and for wet grinding the biggest jar with transparent lid. Now coming to the actual disadvantages if you're going for it to use for dry grinding let me tell you the blades attached to the product are blunt they will not grind anything and you can clearly see the amount of material you have to use to be able to grind in the jar (capacity) in the shots i have attached , 0.6 litre in jar of 1.5 L (wet), 0.5 L in jar of 1.0 L (dry medium jar) , 0.17L in chutney jar of 0.3L . Now you can decide for yourself is it worth the cost you're paying ? That too on the product which comes with blunt blades ? I tell you what i had in mind when i decided to buy this one , 2 years warranty, brand, if the service center is close to the place i live and 750w power for an easy grind based on visual reviews on social media but they're all fake. Even if it had 1000W power motor i highly doubt it would grind due to quality of blades they ve provided. My bajaj grinder gx4( 500w) grinds better (both wet and dry in same jar ) than this waste. So before going for grinder keep these in mind,
1. Blades if they are strong you won't need a high power motor, even a 500 or 600w motor will do the job if their blades are sharp( make sure its stainless steel not aluminum or material with steel coating)
2. Check if jars provided are for dry or wet grinding or both (in case of attached blades) 3. Capacity how much can u actually use out of the jar.
4. Power 500, 600, 750 watt.
5. Quality of material.
5. Warranty , warranty at last because if you end up with product that doesn't grind what will you do with the warranty ? It will be useless.
Last thing, before buying online make sure the product is returnable, the grinder(kitchen product) comes with 10 days replacement policy and amazon refused to take return according to the policy. Ask your friends, relatives and buy offline because online market is filled with duplicate products especially in this time. Plus this model is already four years old.

K,Not the best I've used,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on August 2, 2019",Verified Purchase,"I've used it for one month. My experience so far is neither good nor bad.
Pros: Occupies less space; Philips is a known brand. Reasonable price.
Cons: The steel of the jars and blades is really very thin. I have severe doubts about it's durability.
Also, though 750W, the grinder is not powerful. I have to divide lentils etc into really small batches. My older mixie would grind them in a just one batch, very easily.
The blades are neither screw-on nor removable - they are fixed into the jars, which making cleaning under the blades very tough.
The rubber stubs do not hold well, so the mixie keeps slipping while grinding, and has to be held.
Overall, I'm unimpressed. I may update after using for 6 months.",36 people found this helpful

Krishna,Good one for couples/ working professionals,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on November 13, 2019",Verified Purchase,"My budget is around 3K and I did a lot of research before buying this Mixer grinder. There are quite many options of 750W Mixer grinders in and around 3K price bracket. Brands like Butterfly, Prestige, Preethi & Sumeet(it's traditional one but it's outdated) ..etc

Please don't opt for 500W mixer grinder since we use it for a prolonged period and 500W one won't be good for rough and continuous grinding. Also, you should keep opening the lid of the jar rotate the mix while making wet chutney's as it won't be the finest and mix sticks to the corners of the jar.

This mixer grinder is powerful and comes with 3 jar setup.
Pros:
- The good steel quality of jars
- The motor is powerful and sound is loud since its 750W but it's smooth as compared to others
- IT comes with 2 wet jars(0.3L & 1.5L) and 1 dry jar (1L), completely leakproof

Cons:
- The small jar could have been bigger. It won't be sufficient of making chutney's for more than 2 or 3 peoples
- Main Mixer body plastic quality is OK and not that great, could have been better. However, the quality of the jars is good.

Since the product is from Philips and motor is having 5years of warranty so you can expect good service in case of any issues.

Rajan,Not a Mixer / Grinder which should have Philips logo on it,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on January 17, 2021",Verified Purchase,"I bought this Mixer / Grinder because it is a Philips and because I liked the design of the base. It looks beautiful, and is very compact.

I am however disappointed -

- the materials Philips used are flimsy, the steel jars are thinner than what was there in the older Mixer/Grinder we had

- the jars have two blades and not four; this means in a chutney the coconut pieces are not shredded; (even though I like the pieces of coconut in a chutney)

I used to prefer Philips - possibly because I grew up in an era when Philips was a huge brand; but unfortunately today it does not translate to better quality; and it has a very unhealthy focus on cost cutting.

Nikhil Rodrigues,Worst Mixer Grinder from Philips,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on April 13, 2021",Verified Purchase,"If you are panning to buy this model, read on and AVOID.

1. The dry jar (mid size one), comes without rubber gasket. And the lid does not fit in at all. In fact I feel even with gasket, the lid won't fit in since it's size is clearly different from the jar.
2. So that means you only get 2 usable jars and pay for 3
3. Chutney and wet jars work fine. You need to hold chutney jar very tightly else contents spill. This is worse than previous Philips models we have used. I wonder we are in 21st century and we still need to hold mixer jar tightly and worry about spilling? Poor design by Philips.
4. Sound is not too loud and acceptable. Operation is also fine.

Overall I feel cheated by Philips due to such low quality check, design and reliability. I would say pay a little more and go for brand like Bosch which gives you mixers jars which you don't need to hold while operating.",5 people found this helpful

Sonal Kamat,Looks great but that's all it is worth!,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on July 26, 2021",Verified Purchase,"A very smart looking product by Philips. I am a long-standing customer of Philips. Whether its the electric razors that the men in the family use or its the juicer or the toaster or the mixer grinder that i use. Before I ordered this mixer in October 2019 I had been using a Philips mixer grinder with a 600 W motor for about 7 -8 years. That mixer was a fairly silent machine and grinding quality (for indian consumption- coconut, dal etc) was very good. I had no complaints with that machine so when I saw this mixer which looking smart and came with a 750 W motor and a reasonable price I immediately bought the machine. I have been using this now for almost 2 years. And here is my experience in the last two years :

In the looks department there is nothing missing. But when it comes to performance I give it a zero. The machine is extremely noisy. The grinding quality is also not great. The masalas and the dry stuff grind well, though it takes a bit longer than my earlier mixers which did not have a motor as strong as this one. The jar also heats up in the process. Grinding Coconut chutney, dosa batter, dal is a big task. End result is not good. There are times when I am grinding something and the mixer runs for quite some time but nothing gets ground. For eg - Coriander chutney. All my other mixers did a very fine job. But in this one I need to repeatedly mix the layer else the top layer of coriander just remains as is. And all this while the motor is busy making a loud grinding noise. The extra power does nothing but add noise. Would recommend the 600 W Simply Silent machine to this one. This one is a definite - NO BUY!

The half filled jars leak, splatter and vibrate when in use making kitchen messy 😠.The lids don't have a smaller lid/opening to check consistency of food or to add water.  Need to open the lid everytime, again leading to messy kitchen as food will fall out/coat the lid/jar while opening.  Would be good to have a smaller lid on the bigger wet jar, especially useful while making idly/Dosa batter.  The transparent lid becomes opaque while grinding defeating the purpose of transparent lid.  Extracting butter from curds is messy if the jar of half full 😠Where can I get spare gaskets for the jars as I see they tend to go bad pretty soon.

The jars are thin and the bottom plastics are also weak, they gets severely heated up while grinding spices. The pressure build up inside sometimes get so high that it splashes out the contents which creates a mess and may hurt you.
My previous Philips mixer worked for 20+ years until a few months back when it got short circuited due to a power surge. It never had these kind of issues and the jars were thick and sturdy unlike this one (as you can see in the picture).

Now , coming to its features :- I was very apprehensive of this product at first despite its really good design because I had read a lot of negative reviews regarding its high noise disturbance but having used this product , I can confidently say that any prospective buyer should shed those apprehensions because it is very natural for a 750 W motor to produce a certain decibel of noise which this mixer produces
I am really in awe of the motor as it hardly takes me just a few seconds to grind every thing possible ( even something as hard as rice ) .
The vacuum stand is also amazing as it ensures that the machine is fixed at a place and does not wobble during operation .
The color is amazing and the model looks really sleek and classy

JD,Request for exchange,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on June 16, 2021",Verified Purchase,"Dear Amazon team,
The product is not as the name suggested. The blades of all three jars are of a blender. As a standard atleast the main mixer has to be fitted with a mixer blade or offered as a fitment.

I hereby request Amazon to kindly allow exchange with a mixer as the product purchased will not serve the purpose and will be a wasted investment.

I have already spoken to Mr. Ayoob and Mr. Raj from your team however they wer not able to assist. Request your kind understanding and customer centric solution.",3 people found this helpful
Faza,Jars with pathetic locks. Spillage all over often,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on October 15, 2019",Verified Purchase,"After 3 months of use:
1. Jars have huge lock in problem. The small jar is still reliable but medium jar has no rubber gasket. As a result material comes out often.
2. The large jar also has no locks and ordinary gasket with not so tight lid. Again spillage happens very often. I end up cleaning the whole kitchen.
I had a bajan mixer earlier but only because if Philip's brand name I gave it a try. Will switch back to Bajaj again",4 people found this helpful

Basit Mulla,Splendid Mixer/Grinder by Philips,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on September 3, 2021",Verified Purchase,"After lots of research brought Philips Mixer/Grinder 750W. The product got delivered within 3 days.

It looks cool (black). The design is especially impressive as it is small and round in shape and doesn't require much space in the kitchen. So if you have a small kitchen, I'd recommend this product.

There are many reviews stating this product makes noise but I presume every Mixer/Grinder comes with this feature.😅

Overall the quality is up to mark. 750W motor is powerful enough to get the job done. It comes with 3 jars all with fibre lids and they look durable. The power cord is long enough, so no worries here.

If you are looking something in this range go for it.",One person found this helpful
Manasa,Disappointing product from Philips,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on January 8, 2021",Verified Purchase,"I regret buying this to replace my 8 year old 600watts Silent model by Philips. Should’ve returned it, but somehow got stuck with it now. Noise level is expectedly loud. Apart from the sleek looks, the jars are a horrible mismatch to the motor. They are light weight and thin, blades are the same in all 3 jars, the lids leak and the big jar does not have a dome lid which is useful when grinding. The blades are so bad, that only the bottom contents of the jar grind. The stuff in the jar needs to be mixed manually at regular intervals and this makes it very cumbersome. I hate being stuck with this piece now. Would highly recommend to not buy this appliance. I’m surprised that Philips has such a badly designed product.

Edit: after using this for 4 months, I’ve realised that the lids leak if the inner gasket isn’t fixed properly so as to hold it to the jar when closed. However, the second jar lid missing a gasket and the jar quality and flat lids are still negatives for me. Revised the rating up by a star.",

Noise level of item is average, though we are yet to use it in full kitchen conditions. Jars are sufficiently big enough to cater all requirements including mango shakes. Biggest jar is of 1.5L.

Not sure what the rationale behind this design but I accepted the machine and not going to return just for a small design defect.

Nagendra Kumar,Good product from Philips,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on December 25, 2020",Verified Purchase,"Few points would like to post here,
* Using this product in home for last 2 months and no issues of stoppages observed.
* Since the power of this product is high (750W), the Noise is little louder. But it's okay.
* While grinding hard materials, you'll need to hold the Jar strong enough not to allow the Jar to shake off. This is again because of high power mixer grinder.
* Blades of Jar are made of SS but still be extra cautious about not leaving any water particles on them while not using the Jar.
* FYI, Medium Jar don't have Gasket/Rubber lock with them. Anyway you can buy them from your local Philips store. But you don't actually need gasket for that Jar.

Overall the product is good from Philips",

Got suckered by the brand name of Philips and because Amazon said ‘Amazon’s Choice’. Should have realised it’s an algorithm trained to make us buy and not to give objective view on quality.
The first unit I got had the rivets joining the handle to the jar not even punched properly and were sharp enough to cut the skin. The blades are cheap and the rattle on starting and the mixer is really loud enough to disturb the neighbours. Finally it does a poor job of grinding even basic chutney with some coconut.

Customer,Powerful motor,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on April 20, 2021",Verified Purchase,"The motor is powerful, makes it so easy to prepare smoothies and chutneys!

Just have to make sure to hold the lid down with one hand, otherwise whatever is in the jar ends up on the walls and the kitchen counter. And I'm speaking from experience. So whatever you do, never ever forget to hold the lid down when the mixer is running.

I saw some rust on one of the jars the first time the product was delivered. But when I contacted customer service (the toll free number on the sheet with the safety guidelines and warranty information), they quickly got a local authorized service center to look into it and arrange a replacement jar for me. And when I faced the same issue with the replacement jar as well, they looked into it once again, and provided a second replacement jar without any pushback.

I bought (product name/model): mixer grinder /HL7756/00; Product code : 887775600280 in November 2020. It's been just seven months and it's dry grinding jar and chutney grinding jar has already malfunctioned. Earlier I used to use chutney jar for most of daily chores as it was sufficient for my needs but it stopped functioning, as it was under warranty I replaced it ;even marked my complain to you guys.
Meanwhile I started using dry grinding jar and it met the same faith and haven't replaced it yet. The chutney jar I got as a replacement has malfunctioned too. I am counting on wet grinding jar now but who knows till when it will be working.
Never used it for anything other than chutney making ,grinding onion- tomato and other spices. Grinding daal is a distant dream.

Now I wanna ask what's the point of buying such a heavy duty ,pricey product when I won't be able to use it. You have exaggerated its uses and even claimed warranty of 5 years on motor but it is a hoax as it won't be operational much cause the jars you have provided are not working, this way I am sure it will last for atleast a century, kudos for that.

tmf,Strong product with its own drawbacks.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on October 28, 2019",Verified Purchase,"I got a clear cut used or repaired product. Returned it. Something loose inside. Lots of scratches on machine. Opened and resealed carton with normal adhesive tape.

Got another same machine from different source. Heavy machine. Good one. Sound ok for the watts. Generates lot of heat. Contents of the jar become very hot after finishing grinding.
Three disappointing facts.
1. While grinding using big jar material leaks out through the hole in the center of lid. (Could have been solved by dome shaped lid)
2. Eventhough placed on a steady surface, the machine slightly whirls around during operation, fearing a toppling we have to hold the machine throughout operation with big jar.
3. Not confident that lid wont open up during operation. So have to hold the lid.

The rough and strong nature of the product compensates for the above problems.

Motor of this mixture is 750watts.
Which is not good for normal routine kitchen requirements. It crushes the onion paste to liquid in just 10 sec. For making chatuny it transfer quickly into very thin paste due to higher rpm.
Grinding jar is just 300ml capacity which is very small. Your masala get burned due to excessive heat created and cardemum get struck in the blade and wall which heat up the jar. 500ml jar could be ideal.

SUVRO CHAKRABORTY,A nice product worth purchasing,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on June 17, 2020",Verified Purchase,"The product is quite compact taking up less space. The motor having 750 W is very powerful, grinding things within minutes. There are three jars with capacity 1.5 L, 1L and 0.3 L. The lid of the 1 L jar doesn't come with a girder while those of the other two have girders. Nevertheless all the lids attach to their respective jars tightly and there isn't any spilling of grinding material while using. One also doesn't have to even hold the lids of the jars while using. It is also very easy to clean.
On the flip side, it is a bit noisy though I think it is commensurate with 750 W motor. Another thing, it comes with a two-pin plug.

Dhruv Sood,"WORST PRODUCT FROM PHILLIPS AND CHEAP QUALITY MATERIAL....DONT BUY FROM AMAZON ,DONT BUY PHILLIPS",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on July 12, 2021",Verified Purchase,"THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT I GOT ON AMAZON AND WORST SERVICE. HANDLE IS BROKEN. ON THE JARS INSIDE YOU WILL SEE BIG SCREWS. WHEN YOU WILL USE IT SLOWLY AND STREADLY THE FOOD MATERIAL STARTS TO DEPOSITE IN THE SCREWS AND YOUR JARS STARTS TO SMELL BED. NO GASKET ON THE SMALL GRINDER JAR WHEN YOU GRIND YOU HAVE TO KEEP HOLDING THE LID TIGHT OTHERWISE IS FLIES OFF. I ASK AMAZON FOR REFUNDS AND THEY REFUSE. UNFRIENDLY POLICIES FROM AMAZON TO FLEECE THE CUSTOMERS. SMALL BUTTON MENTIONS 7 DAY REPLACEMENT AND NO RETURNS.

To everyone who's thinking to go for grinder please save yourself from the trouble. We have used it for many purpose but it's of no use . First of all, this product is only for dry grinding both small and medium with opaque lid and for wet grinding the biggest jar with transparent lid. Now coming to the actual disadvantages if you're going for it to use for dry grinding let me tell you the blades attached to the product are blunt they will not grind anything and you can clearly see the amount of material you have to use to be able to grind in the jar (capacity) in the shots i have attached , 0.6 litre in jar of 1.5 L (wet), 0.5 L in jar of 1.0 L (dry medium jar) , 0.17L in chutney jar of 0.3L . Now you can decide for yourself is it worth the cost you're paying ? That too on the product which comes with blunt blades ? I tell you what i had in mind when i decided to buy this one , 2 years warranty, brand, if the service center is close to the place i live and 750w power for an easy grind based on visual reviews on social media but they're all fake. Even if it had 1000W power motor i highly doubt it would grind due to quality of blades they ve provided. My bajaj grinder gx4( 500w) grinds better (both wet and dry in same jar ) than this waste. So before going for grinder keep these in mind,
1. Blades if they are strong you won't need a high power motor, even a 500 or 600w motor will do the job if their blades are sharp( make sure its stainless steel not aluminum or material with steel coating)
2. Check if jars provided are for dry or wet grinding or both (in case of attached blades) 3. Capacity how much can u actually use out of the jar.
4. Power 500, 600, 750 watt.
5. Quality of material.
5. Warranty , warranty at last because if you end up with product that doesn't grind what will you do with the warranty ? It will be useless.
Last thing, before buying online make sure the product is returnable, the grinder(kitchen product) comes with 10 days replacement policy and amazon refused to take return according to the policy. Ask your friends, relatives and buy offline because online market is filled with duplicate products especially in this time. Plus this model is already four years old.",

They were trying to dump an open-box product on me at a full price. This eroded my trust in Amazon India, at least when it comes to buying small appliances. I will have to now think a little more and give physical retail a hard look before making a purchase. I would rather pay a few extra bucks for a peace of mind than gamble over at Amazon. The product itself is ok. Very noisy and bulky for a home mixer. At that price, brand name should not matter much but I don't know why I was  expecting more from Philips.
