they could survive there surely it can for domestic use. I am very satisfied with my sambhar powder, green gram bath powder which turned out fine. The masala for kulambhu's are also smooth. Thanks Sujata.",249 people found this helpful
Chintan,THE BEST MIXER IN THE MARKET,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 21 June 2018,Verified Purchase,"First, we bought Bajaj mixer, very dissatisfactory. We have also had a very bad experience with Philips. Trust me, all these sophisticated looking brands do not do a good job, when you grind dosa batter or black pepper, they just disappoint you. This is THE BEST mixer available in the market, it been a year but till date, my mother praises it every time she uses it.",262 people found this helpful
R,Definitely would recommend!,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 7 April 2021,Verified Purchase,"Initial impression on 07/04/2021:
Bought it via Amazon from k3stores seller.
The jar's base is made of Aluminum metal, whereas mostly other brands provide plastic bases.This could increase the longevity of the jars, but haven't faced any issue previously with plastic base too.
The jars are of good quality and heavy too.
The coupler is made of metal too, and this would definitely increase the longevity of the coupler, as most brands provide plastic ones.
The grinding and build quality are good.
But only, the mixer grinder wobbles and makes high noise while on high grinding mode.
But the high grinding mode isn't even necessary, it grinds well in low grinding mode.

P.S:
""The biggest mistake I did earlier was, went for the brand name. Don't be deceived by the brand names. (I meant Preethi, Philips, and Crompton Greaves)"".
This is the fourth mixer grinder in less than a year.
Earlier purchased Preethi(returned to Amazon), Philips(Unfortunately kept it), and Crompton(Sold it offline within 3-4 months usage), I feel Sujata is better than its competitions.

Update on 24/07/2021:
It's past, 3 months and fortunately no issues till now.

Update on 10/10/2021:
It's past almost 6 months and fortunately no issues till now.",51 people found this helpful
Ivan Coutinho,It surprises you with the power it has,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 23 January 2019,Verified Purchase,"The First thing I did when i got this mixer was make Pepper powder. Put the mixer directly on high, the mixer made some noise for 1 second and then went on at full RPM. Stopped it within 10 seconds, checked the vessel only to see that the pepper was powdered so fine that it felt like talcum powder.

Next was Peanut butter which usually screwed up any mixer i tried it on. Nut not this one, oh no. This went on grinding even though the peanut butter extremely sticky and difficult to make. Within a minute my peanut butter was ready as was smooth as a paste.

Same goes for idli batter. It makes a noise for a few seconds and then grinds at full rpm without any issue.

The blades on all the mixer vessels are very close to the vessel base, which makes for high quality grinding.

Excellent product. My whole Family is happy. Then went on to buy another one for my Aunt. Now then have given the same feedback.

You won't regret buying this product.",103 people found this helpful

Saj,Good product. Small issues with grinding chutneys.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 21 October 2019,Verified Purchase,"Purchased this recently for a deal during a sale, after getting good feedback about this Mixer Grinder. Have used the dome Jar for wet grinding for Iddli,Dosha etc., and it was so quick compared to my 750 watts old mixie, and the grinding was also good and smooth. Noise was also not so irritating. Also used the medium jar for coconut gravy etc. and for juicing watermelin juice and those were also good and fast.Yet to try dry grinding of turmeric,chilly etc.Will update the review then.
Regarding the build quality, the motor part is strong and good.The rotating part on the top is made of metal and not plastic like other mixers.Check the images attached. The dome grinder has clips as well.
The cover attachment around motor part is removable and therfore easy to clean.
Only slight con. felt is that the Jars are slightly loose fit to the motor part cover attachment. Not very loose but feel like we should keep our hands over the Jar while operating(as it is mentioned on all Jar lids already), so doubtful if that is fine or if thats any defect. My old mixer jars were kind of tight fit, so i have even left the wet grinding Jar to work on its own during the operation without keeping my hands above them(Not sure if that was recommended though).

Regarding packaging: It was tight enough and packing was flawless inside the Sujatha carton itself,which inturn was placed inside th amazon carton.

Satisfied now after few days of usage.Looks like this is very durable too.

Edit:Used small jar for chutney grinding and was not very satisfactory just for semi dry chutney.The Jar should be full for proper grinding of coconut for dry/semidry chutney.Adding more water will allow it to grind well but the chutney will become looser(thickgravy like) then.",58 people found this helpful

Seema,Go for it!,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on May 22, 2020",Verified Purchase,"Bought this after a lot of survey online+positive feedback from friends. Was contemplating this against Powermatic,Multimix and the rest and decided to go with Dynamixx. Reasons:-
1)Hardly ever made juice and don't think I will either
2)Stainless steel jars-preferable to polycarbonate, in my opinion.
3)Food processor-how often will I take out the attachments to chop/knead( and then wash them and keep them safely back+space crunch)-Next to never.
And in the last few days I have been amply rewarded. Am enjoying the time I am saving with this solid mixie(work done in 1/4 the time I spent earlier)Have ground dosa batter, coconut chutney (from coconut chunks) and today made coconut milk(pic attached), from chunks again. And am thrilled to say this mixie passed the acid test with flying colors.
This should be in every kitchen as it takes the drudgery out of it ;)

This is a minor defect which could have been rectified during QA process in the Industry.

Sivaramakrishnan,SUJATA DYNAMIX 900W,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on August 7, 2020",Verified Purchase,"POINTERS for those who are in search of a new very good mixer cum grinder:
1. Sujata BRAND MACHINE - DYNAMIX DX 900W, is an UNKNOWN IN MARKET, BUT A SILENT HIGH PERFORMER
2. this machine easily beats hollow all the those well known brands and in market in this category like Preethi, Bosch and others...( I used Preethi exterior steel colour, and which turned to be a great disaster to me within a year and often I needed to spend a lot for repairing and THE WORST EVER NOISE POLLUTER AND I CAN EASILY SAY THE NOISE MADE THE ENTIRE BUILDING TO SHAKE... LEAVE AWAY TH NOISE LEVEL WITHIN THE HOUSE.. SO HORROBLE DESIGN...
3. SUJATA came out with an excellent design and each unit used for grinding is excellently designed thinking on the usability factor from customers perspectives - it is simply a success as seen by the 90% 5&4 rating given by those for this machine by many end users /customers, which none of other brands in India have given such rating. I too stand by those people who rated this machine with a 5* rating.
4. additionally, when I had read the reviews of many users, wished to place an order, but could not place the order as the stocks were unavailable. My enquiries with the customer care could get prompt response whereby by they advised me to get in touch with the zonal head and they shared those numbers as well. But in the process, within a week's time, I could place the order ONLINE itself, as the products were made available and got the delivery PROMPTLY BY AMAZON, BEING PRIME AND AMAZON DELIVERED AS USUAL WITH IMPECCABLE SERVICE...

Baburaj A Puthenveettil,The best mixer available.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on January 2, 2022",Verified Purchase,"Review after two weeks of daily use. I bought this mixie after being fed up with our earlier Philips (the persistent problem of blades getting decoupled from motor at loads, for two philips mixies) and Panasonic ( too noisy, leaky caps, blades getting decoupled and quite difficult to clean). In contrast, this mixie takes whatever is thrown at it nicely. It has a default dry grinder, wet grinder and chutney bowls, all in stainless steel; an extra blender bowl can also be purchased, which I did. The main difference with other mixies is its power (900w), metal couplers on the mixie base ( eventhough the coupler on the bowls are plastic), metal bases for all bowls, including for transparent plastic blender bowl, rotary speed selection switch, which can be rotated in both directions, separate push button for whipping, bowl caps that do not leak etc. Noise is not too much for the power of the mixie. I bought an extra transparent plastic blender bowl, which does an excellent job of blending everything fast. The blender bowl really pulverizes fruits and vegetables into so fine particles in no time so that little is left in the sieve when I sieve for the output to get the juices. I have tried grinding jaggery block in the dry grinder, the jaggery powder became wet due to the moisture within, and it became very tough to mix, the blades even stalled, still nothing happened to the mixie. This mixie is indeed a very powerful task master, it is for nothing that all the juice shops use this mixie. In my opinion this is the best mixie available at this price.",4 people found this helpful

She said even though we spent so much it is worth and made her life easier in kitchen.
Cuffing is made of iron whereas other mixer are made of plastic.

Only drawback is smaller jar used for chutney making is quite lesser in volume.. that is the only negative feedback.

Parthiban J,"Powerful mixer , great value and awesome performance",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on September 8, 2020",Verified Purchase,"I was looking for a powerful mixer that can help us with grinding dosa / idle batter and chose this over a table top grinder has this can be used for multiple other purposes as well. was doubtful about sing 900W grinder due to the heat it may generate but this boy is powerful and yet does not heat up to spoil your batter. It ticks that checkbox.

Value : Got this for 5999 which i think is a good price for such a powerful motor and 3 jars. The build is plastic body but looks sturdy enough, the lock mechanism of the jars is simple.

Cleaning : Easy to clean due to the removable ring around the rotor. The jars themselves are also easy to clean as they are stainless steel.

Performance: Good. Both for wet and dry grinding. All blades do the job.

I would recommend this mixer over any other mixer grinder in the market and if you are a small family that uses user mixer to make dosa / idly batter as well, then don't look no more.",6 people found this helpful

2. They have only one base motor unit for all their appliances, hence you have to use a special adapter ring on top of dynamix, which is a bit flimsy and the cleaning makes difficult as you will have remove this adapter ring.

Kukee,Go for it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on July 18, 2022",Verified Purchase,"People who are satisfied they don't really take a moment to share their experiences and most people review only when they had bad experience. After using this for 2 days I must say that this is the best from all mixer grinders available today. I have used Bajaj, Prestige, Morphy Richard, etc but no one can beat to grind and blend for less than 10 seconds. In these 2 days I blended milkshakes, grinded dal, made 2 different types of chutneys and it hardly takes 5-6 secs or less to get done. Always read the manual first on what ingredients you need to set for grinding and blending once you know then you are good to go. See to be honest those bad reviews it happens with all brands it also depends how you take care of your appliances and even if some gets defect which I don't think so thats very rare but you can't compromise on big reputed Sujata brand many restaurants, stalls, street vendors, food parlors, chefs, whether it's for commercial or home use they buy this brand its obvious why they buy something that has which even other brands or more expensive can't do the job. If you really want for a less maintenance, for longest run use, for all purpose use, for best results, for high quality please go blindly for this brand. You won't disappoint and don't believe unless you try just give it try to this brand.",
ravindranath,Good but chutney grinder could be better,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on December 4, 2019",Verified Purchase,"Decided to buy Sujata mixie after looking at reviews of many users of different brands of mixer grinders and also after physically looking and feeling three of three brands namely Sujata, Preeti and Ultra , short listed by me, at stores. It was difficult to choose between Ultra and Sujata though i decided to buy Sujata. If i need to buy one more i might go in for Ultra. Regarding performance of Sujata, its been a month since i bought this product and right from the look and feel as well as it's working experience i should mention there is nothing to complain and i and my wife are satisfied with Sujata mixer grinder. Why i have given 4 stars and not 5 ? We have got used to the super easy cleaning of Wonderchef blender wherein blades and jars are separate parts.

I am writing this review after nearly two years of usage of dynamix. Chutney grinder is being used by us daily for a family of three. We are facing two problems. Rubber coupler is wearing our faster and more specifically it is leaving black color coating all around the surrounding surface. It looks very bad and difficult to clean. Coupler replacement after certain period is OK. But not this experience before that. I think this could be due to material defect of the black coupler. Another issue with chutney grinder is that the white painting underneath the jar is flaking, peeling off and spreading white granular dust around the mixie. This is not acceptable within two years of usage. We are careful about no water contact underneath the jar. And yet the painting is failing and creating bad feeling. Other two jars are sparingly used and no issues faced so far.",2 people found this helpful

Couldn’t find one that could fit my mixer and still hopeful that will find one suits. To cut long story short, it was weeks and had to buy another. My mum recommended me this, read the reviews and bought.

Have to say, I like everything about it. It can grind things in a jiffy and that too so well, that all my doubts disappeared after the first use. As for the cover of the jar, it’s plastic. I dropped it once and it survived the fall. Noise is as with any mixer and the cable is long. Except the price, I don’t see why one shouldn’t buy it. There was a price drop a day after I bought though.",
Udayakumar T R,The motor is powerful,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on October 19, 2019",Verified Purchase,It is a good mixie working fine till now and it is powerful and well designed.

If something happens by itself of our mistake then we will have to throw it in the dustbin. An expensive mixie should have its spares available at least online which would cost the company nothing.

You literally need only 20-30 seconds to grind anything. Super speedo mixer.

There was tough choice I had to made between this & Bosch. Though later one looked fancy n very tempting. But also had customer complaints on performance.

So I decided to go for Sujata..

Only cons I can think of is color... they only have white.. which is good for first few months but then I'm afraid it would turn pale.

It's totally worth it I would say. Go for it!",

Divya,Perfect for everyone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on June 18, 2021",Verified Purchase,wonderful mixie.. i bought this especially for making dosa batter. and it works perfectly fine for 900 watts.. highly recommend it. Even 500ml jar works good for a single person making coconut chutney. Initially i hesitated for having 500mL jar thinking it wont be good for a single person requiring small amount of chutney. But it proved me wrong. This is perfect for everyone!! made my life easier !!,

Amazon Customer,The Best Mixer Grinder Go For It wihtout Any Doubt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on April 6, 2018",Verified Purchase,"Though I had ordered for 810-watt, I received 900-watt Mixer & Grinder I think they have upgraded 810-watt to 900-watt.
So my review is for 900-watt machines.

As I didn't want to jump to the conclusion, I decided to wait to write this review, Today it is exactly a month (Bought on 5th March 2018 today it is 6th April 2018) since I bought this mixer grinder and in short, if I have to say then ""Without any hesitation go for this machine"" almost every now and then my wife is thanking me (Not Exaggerating)
Build Quality - Excellent be it SS Jar, Plastic Lids, Blades even foreign brands may not match up.
Motor Quality & Noise - Strong, Sturdy and Very low noise compared to many other comparable and high-end machine which we had.
Blades - They are the best.
Jars - Not too big not too small for each application, Highly appropriate and properly sized for the family.

Quality of Grinding/Mixing
Chutney - Never had such smooth chutney.
Tomato Puree - Paste which you ever wanted.
Idly-Dosa Mix - In a zip it makes the wonderful batter.
Khada Masala - You will be amazed at the quality of the powder. All items are grinded evenly.
I can go on and on but here I leave for you to buy it and experience this MADE IN INDIA super quality machine.",20 people found this helpful

Rajeev Singh,Superb Mixer Grinder for Domestic Use,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on August 28, 2018",Verified Purchase,"I have purchased this mixer grinder just one month back. before it, I have used two other brands of mixer grinder since last 20 years in my house. But my experience with this Sujata mixer grinder is very good. In my view, this is the best mixer grinder in the Indian market for domestic use. the quality of steel and plastic is very good. Though it is 900watt motor still the noise is not too high. blades are of very good quality. The motor is very compact. most important thing is that the grinding quality is very good. I have grind 1 kg of unbroken whole turmeric within 10-15 min time with very fine powder. since the motor is in 900watt thus there is no overload protection needed and it can work continuously for more than one hour. Even dosa mix and chutney grinding are also very fine,  and also the grinding is comparatively quicker than other domestic mixer grinders because the rpm of the machine is very high. I will highly recommend this mixer grinder to everyone who wishes to purchase a good quality machine for domestic use.",15 people found this helpful

R.Kalyanasundaram,Suggestions for Improvement,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on August 12, 2017",Verified Purchase,"The product is well engineered and it has the power.
Two things are not up to the mark. 1. The gasket of the domed jar is not flexible and even with low speed, the liquid oozes out, making a mess.
2. The disc blade of the jar is very thin and cuts the hand if not carefully handled while fixing. this should be of thicker material like other brands.
The wire cord is very good and long,but the length poses a problem on the cooking platform. If the extra length of the cord can be fixed with some sort of clip arrangement, it will be convenient.
Still, I recommend this over the makes",7 people found this helpful

Transparent lids with good rubber grip. the rubber grip also slips out very easily for cleaning.
Its definitely not as noisy as bajaj.
Powerful. No doubt about it. Dry grinding is so easy.
I applaud the product designers. They must have given a lot of thought for taking care of little things. Even the placement of switches.

Wall-e,Best value and star of the pack,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on June 3, 2021",,"This was our third mixer and we spent a lot of time exploring other options.
The item was pricier, going out of stock and so we went to an offline retailer for the buy.

We are a small family and grinding used to be a chore - wife uses this more frequently than Tabletop Grinder now. Small batches of Dosa and Idly batter are breeze and saves our hours spent on cleaning up the Tabletop in the WFH days. There might be small chinks with the build, but this product delivers in everything else. You won't even remember there's a mixer in your house or worry about what brand it is when something delivers functionally so well. Might look expensive at first, but you realize that this is worth it when after a year, you seem to be using it for so little time, even after plugging it in almost on a daily basis for something or the other. It probably is a tiny little noisy because of the bigger motor, but it takes so little time to do anything, that it's totally accpetable. I used to hear the complaints about the old mixer so frequently and after we bought this, i never heard a murmur about this having a problem.

Realized the variants are many, but at the heart of it, its the same motor with different jars and outer body, so pick what you need rather than worrying about what variant fits best. We bought a dynamix considering our usage which doesn't involve any juicing or mixed use for grinding idly, dosa doughs too.
I hate shopping too frequently and prefer functionality over the shine, and this worked so well, that now i try to look at most of our buys through a similar filtering criterion!

A knight in not too shiny armor is what i'd say! One of the best and Made in India too!

Added edit:
It's been more than a couple of years since brought this home. When I hear someone is looking for a new one.. i confidently recommend this. Great product.

Another year later:
The mixer is going great, we don't even move it much. It's now pretty much a fixed object in our kitchen! Thanks Sujata for this most rugged and meanest beast of a mixer!",3 people found this helpful

Sendil,Small change in blade helps a lot,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on July 12, 2022",,We bought this mixie in Jan 2020 within the first few wet grinding the whole plastic near the locking area melted. Under warranty it was repaired and again we had the same issue and it was repaired promptly. But on the root cause I found out tat the heating was due to the blade supplied along . I replaced the smaller wet grinding blade from older mixie and it's superb fine with no heating problem. Also please use full speed while wet grinding it helps lower the motor heat.,
Shankarprasad,Powerful 900 W Motor. Tough body. Low noise.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on July 22, 2017",,Very powerful Mixer Grinder. New model has 900 W. Therefore no overload reset problem like my old mixer. Comparatively very low noise than other 750 W mixers in Market. And the outer body and steel jars also made of high quality materials and feels very powerful. Beware of one thing. When grinding is made sometimes suddenly it make an abnormal loud noise. This is because of  the paste  go up and an air bubble created inside the Jar and the powerful blades rotates inside this air bubble makes this voice. If it occurs switch off it and just press the WHIP button  for  1 or 2 seconds. And starts again. This will make the paste uniformly distributed  inside the jar. And it will start the normal running again without loud noise.,One person found this helpful

Ineya,A Great choice for daily home usage!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on April 28, 2021",Verified Purchase,"I purchased Sujata mixer grinder 900W, after trying 2other popular brands. Had to return them due to high noise and performance issues. I was doubtful on the noise level as this is 900w, but to my surprise this creates very less noise compared to usual 750w mixie. Very fast grinding. For wet grinding it has direct switch to 3rd speed which is very useful. Jar gets heated up little, is the only remark, but it should be expected. A great choice for daily home usage, I am very satisfied with the performance!",
