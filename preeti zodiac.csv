Subhasis G.,More than what is expected.demoralised now.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 27 August 2018,Verified Purchase,"This is the 3rd processor I am using in last 18 years. Singer, Kenstar and now this. After lot of research I have gone for this. Excellent product performance has gone beyond my expectation. A little more noise may be because of higher motor power. I am highly recommending this product to all specially for the size and high utility of Chatney jar. I can comment on durability after a year only but till date it is superb. Value for money. Thanks Amazon for promoting such good product. After sales service I haven't required yet and I think with Amazon there will be no problem if required at all.
But now the small bowl has cracked in October as it is July purchased. Will try for replacement",512 people found this helpful

BabaYaga,Honest Zodiac mixer grinder review,1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 31 October 2019,Verified Purchase,"As of OCT-31-2019, there are over 250 people who has given bad reviews on this mixer. And I do agree with them because the quality of this 750W mixer grinder compared to the better Brand competitors like Bosch and Ultra, who offers you 1000W for lesser price than Preeti. I'm writing this review to help people not to be misguided by some five star reviews, I'm just saying there are other good brands like Bosh and Ultra. I request you to carefully search for reviews on this mixer before buying. And I also request Amazon to consider this and collect feedback from other buyers as well and stop selling this mixer grinder not to mention the service from Preeti is awful compared to Bosch. And again the quality of Preeti mixer is just horrible. The jar nicks, dents and dings. The lid breaks if you just accidentally drop it from 5 feet to ground. Amazon only gives you replacement and no refund for this order. Lastly, I request y'all please don't buy this product. And those photos are from the damaged mixer grinder which I've received for the second time which are damaged inside the box which shows the durability of the steel jars. I suggest you checkout the other images from the reviews which has different images of parts broken.",151 people found this helpful

@j@y t@wr@ni,Super Pathetic,1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 3 November 2018,Verified Purchase,"Pathetic product. Plz don't go by its looks or the video they have shown. Barely after using it for 6 months, the wheels of the jars have started to give up. The mechanism of the aata kneading jar has gone bad completely after the regular use of 6 months & we've been told to buy a new jar. Initially we did not need all the jars & hence we'd kept it one as spare only to realize it later that one of the jars was actually broken. After using kenstar for more than  11yrs, I totally regret buying this product. Their customer care was of no help, when emailed the customer care of their company for the assistance. There are no replacement jars available in the market & the ones available online are expensive.",129 people found this helpful
Arun,Detailed review which many might miss,3.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 1 March 2019,Verified Purchase,"The product is good. It does the job as promised in the advertisements.
The master chef jar is very good:
Chopping and and grating happens in minutes. But the blades in the rotating disc cuts the plastic along with the vegetable. We made carrot halwa and i was astonished with the speed at which the blades were grating the carrot. But only while eating carrot halwa we came to know that the blades were also grating the plastic lid that was coming in contact with the blades. It is not healthy to eat plastic right !!!.

Dont use atta maker unless you are in a hurry. The chappati or roti wont be soft.
Citrus juice extractor needs to be handled with caution. It may hurt your fingers.

Juicing jar:
Juicing jar is fine. But be careful what you add in the juicing jar. If you use juicing jar for extracting milk out of coconut dont use dispencing lid . It will break the dispensing lid for sure.",91 people found this helpful

Aishwarya  Pratap Singh,Seriously not recommended....Very disappointed....Don't buy !!!!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on May 3, 2020",Verified Purchase,"Built Quality :- Let's start from the built quality, Although the product looks premium in the advertisements, in reality, the plastic used is of VERY AVERAGE quality. JARS ARE ALL PLASTIC which was not expected at this price point...Average build was not expected from such a reputed brand.

Customer Service/ Support :- Upon receiving the product, I did not recieve even a single call for installation or demo etc. from the company/ brand although the other competing brands are providing proper installation and demonstration with their products. Spares and Service are available only in very limited states and service and spares are PRACTICALLY NON -EXISTENT IN NORTH INDIA. So, if you bought this mixer grinder in North India, and your product develops problems , You are literally doomed..!!

Durability :- Although we are a family of just 2, and cook only once in a day, and sometimes even use the mixer grinder just one or twice in a whole week., But, Within 6 months, the coupler came out and had to be replaced. But, since spare parts availability is such an issue in North India , I had to buy replacement coupler from third party.

Grinding :- 1.) Although motor is advertised to be heavy (750 watts), but the grinding quality is very AVERAGE. The grinding is NOT UNIFORM and even while grinding relatively softer items like biscuits or smoothies, we must expect LUMPS ....(Imagine my surprise, when It took me 3 cycles of grinding just to grind soft biscuits into a lump free mass...)
2.) Noise levels from the motor are very high and I would recommend to use some kind of ear protection if using the mixer grinder for prolonged duration.

Overall a very AVERAGE PERFORMANCE and therefore not worthy of its premium price tag.....",25 people found this helpful

Sup.,Must have appliance,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on August 11, 2020",Verified Purchase,"The best appliance in kitchen. I have tried the next 2.0 but this zodiac mixer grinder is worth every penny. It grates (slightly bigger grate than expected of manual grating. Hack: after grating, attach chopping blade and pulse once or twice),
It chops (be careful to do pulsing for a second or two, it could be sufficient),
Kneads flour very well,
Wet grinder and dry grinder works well for dosa/idli grinding and dry spices grinding respectively.
Juice grinder is great. Helps with seperation of seeds in watermelon.
In the processor attachment, slicing is bit thick, but doable.
Also, citrus fruit juice extractor is great for its cause and serves purpose.

Everything inside the box should be covered with bubble sheet so that there is no chance for any damage.. my first delivery was fully damaged product and the only reason I can see because all the components and parts inside the box  was not packed properly.

Amazon Customer,Total waste of money.

Not worth the money you are paying. Plus on this Amazon have only replacement option no return.

I found the following problems with the product :
1. Very cheap quality plastic is used. Plastic componants are starts to crack after 2-3 times of use.

2. Poor build quality. The main unit (motor unit) can't take load of the master jar vibration. So it will break after few uses. Master jar it too big to fit on the small machanism (master jar fitting with main unit).

3. The controlling Switch is also very flimsy. It feels like it can break any time.

4. Not stable as said, you need to hold the jars and the machine using both hands while using. Otherwise it starts to vibration drastically and may cause accident.

5. Finally there are verious reviews (I think most of them are not genuine about the product, may be paid (possibly). Don't fall trapped in such reviews.

Just checke the above points while using the product by yourself (better you can take home demo by paying Rs. 250 as they offer). After all loosing Rs. 250 is better than loosing Rs. 7,000 approx.",9 people found this helpful

Saurabh,Unsafe product,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on December 16, 2020",Verified Purchase,"The mixer is powerful and versatile, blades and sharp, performance is good as well. However its safety design is very poor. The blades are very difficult take out, the locking/unlocking mechanism has a lot to improve. It led to two incidents in the kitchen. Today my mom's fingers got severely cut and we had to rush to hospital to get stitches. That was after following instructions, nobody at home could get the blades out from the mixer.

MUHAMMED HASHIM,Poor Packing & Damaged MasterShef's Jar screw on the first use,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on August 28, 2021",Verified Purchase,"I have ordered this product after so much study and reference. Then I have booked Preethi Zodiac on 20.08.2021 and delivered on 23.08.2021. I was happy & delighted with the  timely delivery. But the happy & delightment was for a short time. Amazon's outer cover was ok..but the product's original cover was broken and shabby. The cover's all the edges were broken and tied with lot of tapes. I felt the product was a returned item or refurbished item. Some jars was placed without plastic covers. It was placed without arranged or dislocated. Me and my family was very disappointed after seeing the product packaging. I did not expected such an experience from Amazon. Really disheartened experience from Amazon. I am wondering why this carelessness for such an expensive product from a reputed and trusty firm. This is really not appreciated.

SS,My second review,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on July 19, 2021",Verified Purchase,"Looks like my last review was very strong and hence was taken down. I am trying to be more polite this time but I will still be true.

Overall the mixer is okay. The biggest downside is that it uses the same wheel gear for kneading,chopping, mixing and juicing.
While most of it just works, the biggest problem is kneading which we usually do daily.
Kneading the dough equires the kneading attachment to be placed. Which means an extra layer of gear attachment in technical sense. Gear of this kneader is not silent and it adds to a tremendous noise level. I completely dislike this noise level and planning to sell off this mixer... As this noise seems to be not possible to fix. It is there by design.
Hope this time the review will help the people who are staying with elderly or someone who is not tolerant this much noise level and help them decide appropriately.",2 people found this helpful
SRD,A tractor sound mixer-huge noise and vibration,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on October 15, 2020",Verified Purchase,"very complicated to use for making juice, they gave a system for filtering automatically, but fitting this is not easy task.
High noise and observing smoke as well in just 5 minutes of usage.. --in first month itself need to look for customer care to ask about the noise and vibration to check is it normal with this .

Using for Idly batter- its quick enough to make the batter, but the sound is horrible. and we cant hold for 2 minutes for its heavy vibration. Its not hands free.

Absolutely not worth for the price. Not peace of find... I came to this from Bosch mixer only for Chpathi making is there here, but the basic , juicer and mixer is so noisy...

So everyone pls check and only then place order! As below are main issue:
1. The base of all jars are so small that you have to do proper balancing act while placing on shelf else even a small touch makes the jar fall down. You can refer the photo and see if u take it out from grinder if weight is on one side it is difficult to place on stand.
2. The plastic and steel jar quality is not good compared to Philips. The blades also not that good where quality is cheap.
I can see small plastic chips are coming out of blades. Refer the pic carefully where small black dot on floor is plastic chip from machine! What if it goes in food! and seems to dangerous. And with all these they are saying return is not possible.",3 people found this helpful
Vani R.,Overpriced product. don't waste the money.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on June 21, 2021",Verified Purchase,"I am using this product from May 17. I was expecting a super performance quality for the price I have paid. But it's turns out to be normal. There is no doubt that product looks great, quality of plastic and steel used are great. But when it comes to performance I would give it 2 stars.

There are 3 speeds available. When I turn it to speed 2, it smells as though motor is burnt and makes too much noise.

When it comes to Juicer, it's a total waste of money. You can only use it for soft fruits like water melon, etc. I tried to make carrot juice, it was a mess, there is more waste than the juice extracted. I didn't get a cup of carrot juice from 1/2 kg of carrot. I had to sqeeze the waste manually 🙄

Coming to chopping, it's useful only for some veggies which needs to be cut in large quantities. This is also a waste.

For dosa batter grinding, I can't leave the grinder on without holding the cap in one hand. Otherwise, cap will come off from pressure. Dosa batter takes longer to make.

Earlier I was using Butterfly mixi with 750 watts , I regret that I should have bought that one again.

Definitely this is overpriced. There are better 750 watt mixis with excellent quality. I am planning to buy one more as I am not happy with this.

While purchasing I didn't see that this product is only replaceable, my bad. Otherwise I would have returned it.",2 people found this helpful

Earlier also i had used preethi mixer with 3 jar and was wel satisfied with it compared to this one, the reason is, the jars are grinding only if the quantity is less and upto just above the blade level. If the quantity is added a little more, the top level content is not grinded well.

Chapathi made with atta kneaded in this mixer it not good. Thus i rate the atta kneader to 1.

Able to knead atta so easily. juicer is patented design and works well. No hassle in changing blades as written in some review. Havenot tried wet grinding yet in my 6 days of usage.
Noise level is bit high but its ok for the 750 W power machine.
Good product, if bought within 6K, slightly priced high",2 people found this helpful
