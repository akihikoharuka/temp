I used it with two small jars and it worked well. However, when I used the big jar after a week or so, I found it leaking. I wanted to return it to the supplier through Amazon, but by that time the return date was over. I should have checked the big jar immediately after receiving the item. When I contacted Preethi service centre to come and repair, the answer was that I have to take the item to their service centre which is about 12 kms away from my residence.  I have to plan to go there one day. Till today, it is lying unused.",171 people found this helpful

Nazeer,"Please don't waste your money by buying ""Preethi Blue Leaf Diamond 750 Watt Mixer Grinder""  !!",1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 22 June 2020,Verified Purchase,"After using 5months thought to write feedback.
1. Product is from good mixer brand Preethi. ""However this model is disastrous""
2. Undergone ""more than 5times repair"" like, (Blade, Coupler damage, etc..)
3. Although, capacity states 750w, it hardly performs (frequent tripping - real test for patience)
4. Neither customer service nor availability of nearby brand shops - greatly disappointed
5. Eventually, after series of repairs, we have decided to buy new mixer from ""reputed brand""
6. Truly pathetic product, particularly ""Preethi Blue Leaf Diamond""
7. Preethi brand not ready to repair or replace the product, instead suggested to reach out to Amazon, isn't it funny ? Poor customer care response!

Bottom line: based on my personal experience, i strongly suggest ""Not to waste money buying this product"" it is not just money, it is about ""daily and weekly hassles"" therefore ""you may end-up buying another product""

Amazon Customer,Technician would be needed every quarter,1.0 out of 5 stars,Reviewed in India on 20 August 2019,Verified Purchase,"Hi
Had taken Preeti mixer after hearing great reviews from some friends but I guess that the current designs are not great at all.
In nearly 9months of use had to call the technician nearly 3-4times to get the wheel which rotates the jar fixed as it losens from the wheel below. We are a family of 3 and our usage is very limited with the jars as we don't grind any idli Rosa Bater etc in it.

This is a technical mistake that cannot be rectified and technician visit every quarter would be a must.

My recommendation is to check the mixer jars technically before you purchase.",16 people found this helpful

Vikas Sharma,Substandard Product - Pathetic Mixer and Mainly Jar Quality,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on November 17, 2020",Verified Purchase,"I purchased this Preethi Diamond Mixer Grinder after recommendations from My friends but lookslike Preethi manufacturing substandard products and cheats customers with fake promises. I will highlight a few points which clarifies your doubt and reconsiderations:
1: Motor heats up within 20-25 5 seconds and creates foul small/ sound.
2: Due to heating issues (Hardly run 20-25 seconds) wheel melted for one of the 1.5 lt Jar. Try to grind Onion and Tomato.
3: Small jar creates so much heat after running 6-7 minutes which could burn a finger. Accidently this had happened to me, while grinding mint leaves within a few seconds after realizing some foul smell, i tried to open the Jar i got this burn mark.

Hope these help you to decide to stay away from Preethi.
Basically, it appears like a substandard product for a 750-watt motor, it would not have heat up that fast. Even the grinding is not happening properly
Trust me jar quality is extremely poor.
Last, kindly make arrangements to reimburse the total amount and take this pathetic Preethi Mixer Grinder.

Manish Holla,Extremely robust product in it's price segment,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on November 17, 2019",Verified Purchase,"It was my first ever purchase of mixer exceeding 550W. So I was a bit curious to what power it can deliver.

I just put the chutney grinder with nothing inside it and turned to whip mode. To my astonishment, the whole body of mixer grinder turned at once (not exaggerating). Ooofff
My old prestige 550w Juicer mixer grinder didn't even had enough power to churn the spices.
I purchased this from Cloudtail India for ₹2999 on Deal Of The Day. You will get a big jar, 1 small jar, and 1 tiny jar (Tiny in the sense smallest among them). The plastic body quality is nice. There is a white indicator just beside the knob to let you know if there is power supply to the mixer.
The gauge of wire is good with respect to the current being passed. It is thick and there are 3 terminals (earth, positive, negative), unlike my old one which had only 2 terminals that too, the wire was thinner than tissue paper😅 and quality objectionable. *Do register you product on Preethi mixer website to avail warranty.*

Overall this purchase was made nice by Amazon fulfillment and the product is nice

It served me well in Bangalore too.  But slowly, the blades, jars tops and motor started to give way.  For 6 years I never once had to  service it.  I ordered the Preethi Zion but it was too huge for my kitchen.  Post a lot of reading ( A South Indian is always a huge Made in India -Preethi Fan) I picked the three jar Preethi Blue Leaf Diamond.  It arrived on time (as Amazon always does).  The product did not have any physical damages.  The Date of Manufacturing on the box was current.  It has been over a week and it performs really well.  Compared to my old mixer, the noise on this one is music to the ears. The jars have no issue currently be it the rubber or the jar tops ( as complained by many reviewers).  I use mixer every day - from juices to curries, chutneys to powders , it is a must have in my kitchen. Blue Leaf is compact, sits pretty on the counter top, looks simple and does its job.  The medium jar is much smaller in size compared to the older model I had.  The bigger jar is a fair size.  The smallest one is the standard size.  I would say it has two small jars and one big one.  Very handy for a small family.  I am very happy with my purchase.  I would however like to reassess post few weeks. Hoping that it stands the test of time!",7 people found this helpful

Not like any other grinder where you just keep the machine on for a min and you see things inside jar are not that smoothened but it's different with preethi

I got this for a good deal of 2700 during deepavali sale
Only dislike was the packaging, it came with direct package meaning I could see preethi company box when delivery was given no. Extra care or Amazon package was done.

This could have damaged the product but nothing happened in my case and I had double thought if I need accept it or send it bac. Finally opened the box and saw that all things were safe.",6 people found this helpful

We called the Service Centre, but kept getting told to call a different number.

We pressed the switch as instructed but it still did not work.  After 3 more calls they arranged to send a technician over to look at the machine without charge.  We received two SMS with different name and mobile number of technician and date.  But nobody came.  We called again twice and then one agent said they will send somebody but there is a charge of Rs. 120 - previously they said it was free.

coming to negatives,
The jars of Dimond series are not suitable for whipping (egg/butter milk) etc.

ashok kumar,Defective mixer grinder given for 600/- rupees less price.,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in India on March 18, 2022",Verified Purchase,"I brought this product again after returning the same product because the listed price was 600/- rupees lesser than the one I brought just a day back.  But now I regret buying this, coz this mixer makes a lot of noise from the very first use.  Also, the 2 jars provided are not useful for grinding even coconut chutney with lumps of coconut pieces remaining as it is and even I could not prepare apple juice with the mixer failing to properly grind the apples.  I THINK I WAS SOLD A REFURBISHED MIXER GRINDER WITHOUT THIS BEING ACTUALLY  MENTIONED IN THE PRODCUT DESCRIPTION.  I would be happy if they would take it back and give me a good mixer grinder.  Hope to get a response.",

It is okay, i would say.
An update after a month
The product is good looking but highly impractical when it comes to functioning. Sometimes i wonder what goes in the mind of people who design these. Is it to be used as a kitchen showpiece or as an aid to the multi tasking, hassled Indian woman? Everything from fixing it on its base unit to detaching it is an ordeal. Not to mention the stubborn lid and the cleaning part. The ease of use is abysmally low. If there's a choice in this segment, please don't go for this.",
